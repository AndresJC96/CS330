Reflection

When I approach designing software, I try to simplify the big picture first. For this project, I started by breaking the 2D image down into basic shapes like boxes, spheres, and cylinders instead of overcomplicating it. That helped me focus on structure before details. This class helped me develop stronger spatial thinking in 3D space, understand lighting models, and think more carefully about transformations and object relationships. I followed a milestone by milestone process where I built the shape first, adjusted transformations, applied textures, and then refined lighting. That step by step approach is something I can apply to any future project because it keeps the work organized and manageable.

When developing programs, I focus on getting something working before trying to perfect it. In this 3D scene, I tested objects incrementally and adjusted values constantly. Iteration played a huge role because nothing looked right on the first try, especially lighting and positioning. Over the milestones, I became more comfortable debugging and thinking through problems instead of getting overwhelmed. Computer science allows me to turn ideas into real working systems, and computational graphics strengthened my understanding of linear algebra, vectors, and how rendering actually works. These skills will help me academically in more advanced courses and professionally in areas like game development, visualization tools, or any role that requires structured problem solving and technical depth.
